	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>Lootstrap started life as a direct port of <a href="https://cutestrap.com">Cutestrap</a> and simply wouldn't exist without it. The core of the vertical rhythm and forms is still primarily the work of <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/">Tyler Childs</a>. While I'm still using Cutestrap with a few modifications for a few other sites with text-heavy content, I also wanted something built to be customized further—mostly through configuration. Lastly, old habits die hard and I prefer a different naming convention, specifically one derived from Twitter Bootstrap.

	<p>Lootstrap is not intended to be used as-is. There's nothing stopping you from <a href="lootstrap.min.css">grabbing the compiled CSS</a> (which is only ~12k before gzip compression) and throwing it in a <code>link</code> if you really want to do so, but that doesn't really get you a whole lot of utility. Instead, the intention is for you to build your own custom styles using the core as a library of LESS variables and mixins, with some Cutestrap-inspired defaults. The basic flow to make that happen is pretty simple:

	<ol>
		<li>Create your core stylesheet (<code>/src/styles/style.less</code>, in this case).
		<li>Import the Lootstrap variables (as easy as <code>@import (reference) 'lootstrap/core-variables.less';</code>).
		<li>Update/override any variables you want. Look through the core variables file mentioned above for examples and info.
		<li>Include mixins–whether you want to use the defaults, your own custom variations, or a mixture of both.
		<li>Now you can include the core elements and classes, using your customized variables and mixins.
		<li>Optionally, you can include any modules you may want to use. The core modules simply act as shortcuts for the default mixins.
		<li>Append any additional styles in LESS, using the variables and mixins available to you from steps 2–4.
		<li>Let grunt compile your CSS, apply vendor prefixes, and minify the results.
	</ol>
